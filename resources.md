## How to set it up
In order to use the full feature set of the Craft Library or start from the
latest version of the Sketch template, it is important to sync the shared
OneDrive folder to your computer. However, *syncing with OneDrive isn't quite
as simple as Google Drive, so bear with us through the next few steps*.

### Syncing a Shared OneDrive folder

-   **Make sure that your version of OneDrive was downloaded from the Managed
Software Center.** Rackspace has built an update to the program that enables us
to sync shared folders, so If you download it from another source it will not
work. If your computer does not have the Managed Software Center installed on
it, you'll need to go to O'Fixies to install it.

<div class="row">
{% column left:"col-md-4" %}
-   Visit the link above and click the "Sync" button.
{% endcolumn %}
{% column right:"col-md-7" %}
![](http://screenshots1234.s3.amazonaws.com/ybRVG6nQomLK085XPQRCjhAWmUzBz8Vtru.png){:width="80%"}
{% endcolumn %}
</div>

<div class="row">
{% column left:"col-md-4" %}
-   Syncing the folder will create a second OneDrive folder on your computer.
    It will also add the folder as a second location to your OneDrive App.

    {% include tip.html content="DO NOT rename these folders." %}
{% endcolumn %}

{% endcolumn %}
</div>

## How to use it

### Sketch Template

<div class="row">
{% column left:"col-md-4" %}
If you choose the Sketch template you can create a new file from it and edit it
as you wish without affecting the original document. Sketch maintains the link
to the template in your "New from Template" menu. So if you selected it from
the shared drive above, it will always access the most up to date file.
{% endcolumn %}
{% column right:"col-md-7" %}

{% endcolumn %}
</div>

### Craft Library

<div class="row">
{% column left:"col-md-4" %}
If you aren't familiar with Craft, it is a Sketch add-on that includes a
feature for shared libraries. If imported into your project the Craft library
will automatically alert you when new assets are available.
{% endcolumn %}
{% column right:"col-md-7" %}
![](http://design.rax.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Design-System-Sketch-3.png){:width="80%"}
{% endcolumn %}
</div>

If you've never used Craft before, we urge you to take a minute to learn about
it before diving in:

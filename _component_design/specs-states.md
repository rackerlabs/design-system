# Specs and states

Use the sections on this artboard to document construction specifications for
your design; elements such as fonts, colors, padding, margins, and line-height. 

**Important: These states will not apply to all design patterns, and many design
patterns will have states not included here. We recommend deleting states you
do not need, and add sections to this artboard for any states you do need.**

## Default Layout

Drop-downs

{% figure [caption:"Default layout"] [class:"image bg-light border"] %}
 ![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/components/content-areas/dropdowns/dropdowns-default-layout.svg){:width="80%"}
 {% endfigure %}

## Drop-down states

Drop-downs can be in the following states:

* Default
* Disabled
* Focus
* Error

{% figure [caption:"When you need to describe an image in greater detail, use this block
 of text so that you can keep the left area clutter-free. 3 lines or less."] [class:"image bg-light border"] %}
 ![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/components/content-areas/dropdowns/dropdowns-states.svg){:width="80%"}
 {% endfigure %}

## Option label

Clicking a drop-down menu displays the options contained within the dropdown.

{% figure [caption:"When you need to describe an image in greater detail, use this
 block of text so that you can keep the left area clutter-free. 3 lines or less."] [class:"image bg-light border"] %}
 ![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/components/content-areas/dropdowns/dropdowns-option-label.svg){:width="80%"}
 {% endfigure %}

## Drop-down data states

Once a drop-down menu is expanded, the options contained within have four
states:

* Default
* Hovered
* Selected
* Selected and hovered

{% figure [caption:"When you need to describe an image in greater detail, use this
 block of text so that you can keep the left area clutter-free. 3 lines or less."] [class:"image bg-light border"] %}
 ![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/components/content-areas/dropdowns/dropdowns-data-states.svg){:width="80%"}
 {% endfigure %}

### Minimal progress bar

The minimal progress bar provides the user with a simple visual to ascertain the status of a process. As a process moves forward, the fill of the progress bar grows to indicate progress to a user.

### When to use

Use anytime you want to simply convey the progress of a process. 

### Best practice

- A progress bar shines best in small spaces and **should not** have a max-width over `400px` wide.
- **Do not** overclutter a progress bar with information around it as excess information reduces the simplicity and effectiveness of the pattern.
- **Do not** make the progress bar taller as the _y_-axis of the progress bar conveys no visual information on progress.

### Composition

A progress bar is composed of a containing shape (empty fill) and a progress indicator (loading fill).

<div class="hxRow" markdown="1">

{% column left:"hxCol hxSpan-12-xs hxSpan-12-sm hxSpan-4-md hxSpan-4-lg" %}

### Spacing

A minimal progress bar should have `8px` of `padding` around its container to allow for visual distinction. It typically anchors left, in which case the `padding-left` is optional.

### Specifications

The minimal progress bar is `8px` tall with a `cyan 500` loading fill and a `gray 400` empty fill. There is no minimum or maximum length for progress bars, however, we advise the boundariesare no smaller than `240px` and no larger than `400px`. These boundaries are for aesthetic purposes and for ease of user consumption. These dimensions allow a user to see the entire progress bar in a single glance, rather than have to track across the screen to understand the progress being made.

### Behavior and context

The minimal progress bar does not have state changes itself. When it appears, it appears with 100% empty fill and loads with the loading fill corresponding to its progress. When it is done loading, the loading bar disappears and the interface designers can replace this content with more useful content.

- **Contextual changes:** While processing, subdue the opacity of the surrounding elements to 60%, such as icons and text, so the user understands processing elements are in a transient state. Any buttons or controls that cannot be acted on should be hidden (if hiding is not an option, subdue them) until they can be acted on. Buttons or controls that **can** be acted on should remain at full opacity.

- **Error states:** If an item has trouble loading, the progress bar itself does not convert to error state, but the pattern that the progress bar is a part of does. That pattern should follow our [text fields]({{site.baseurl}}/components/text-fields#states-overview) error state guidelines, which include presenting an error message with an error icon. From that error message, the user may choose to retry or eliminate the item processing.

- **Focus state:** As there is no action that can be taken directly on the progress bar, there is no focus state. Controls for actions on the progress bar, including but not limited to pausing or removal, should be indicated in that specific pattern outside the scope of the progress bar itself.

## When to use

Users want to know if an action they initiated was successful or not successful. If a user action is not successful, the user wants to know why. Use a toast notification when you want to close the workflow feedback loop on a user action.

For example, use a toast when you want to:

- Notify the user that an operation was successful.
- Notify the user that an operation resulted in an error.
- Provide information to the user about an operation.

To determine whether a toast is the appropriate notification method, consider how the workflow begins and ends. A toast notification is most appropriate for workflows initiated and completed when the user clicks a button.

Do not use a toast in the follow situations:

- To notify the user of promotional or marketing material, such as the announcement of a new feature.
- For actions that are in context to the page or region. For those cases, use an [alert bar]({{site.baseurl}}/components/alert-bar.html).
- For form validation.
- If the user's acknowledgement of the notification message is required.

## Best practices

Consider the following best practices when you construct a toast:

- Construct the toast so that the user can navigate away and still be notified in their current context when the user-initiated process completes or fails.
- A toast can include an optional call-to-action (CTA) that navigates the user out of the current page, or that triggers an action.
- Only use one CTA for a toast. Do not include a **Dismiss** or **Close** CTA.
- If there is an error and the user can take an action to correct it, include a CTA.
- Use human-friendly, complete sentences when you write the notification message. For more information about writing notification message, see [Alert and Message Guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/style/alert-messages.html).
- The notification message should not exceed more than four lines, excluding the CTA.
- The user can click **Close X** to close the toast.
- A toast remains open when the user hovers over it and closes when the cursor moves off of it, provided that the full 10 seconds has elapsed. Refer to [Behaviors]({{page.url}}#behaviors) for more information about toast timing.

## Specifications

Refer to the following specifications when you construct a toast.

### Composition

A toast is comprised of the following elements:

- **Container (required)**: The container holds all elements of the toast notification.
- **Notification message (required)**: The notification message explains the result of the action taken by the user.
- **Accent border (required)**: The color of the accent border corresponds to the notification type.
- **Notification type indicator (required)**: The notification icon corresponds to the notification type.
- **Close X (required)**: The user can click **Close X** to close the notification. The notification automatically disappears after 10 seconds.
- **Footer (optional)**: The footer can contain a link or a button call-to-action (CTA).

### Style

The three types of toast notifications are Success/Confirmation, Informational, and Error.

Use these specifications when you construct a toast.

### Spacing

While the height of a toast is dependent on the length of the notification message, without including a footer, 56px is the minimum height. If you include a footer, the height of the toast notification can increase.

Refer to these spacing specifications when you construct a toast.

### Behaviors

Ensure that a toast supports the following behaviors:

 - **Placement and stacking**: Place toasts in the top-right corner of the page, 32px beneath the eyebrow. If more than one toast notification is triggered simultaneously, vertically stack them 32px apart, with newer toasts placed on top. Refer to [Eyebrow]({{site.baseurl}}/components/eyebrow.html) for information about constructing an eyebrow.
 - **Animation and timing**: The toast fades in over `400ms`, remains for 10 seconds, and then fades out over `400ms`. If the user hovers over the toast while it is fading out, it immediately gains full opacity. A toast persists indefinitely on cursor hover. When the cursor moves off the toast, the toast persists for three more seconds, and then fades out over `400 ms`.

## Variation

You can use the footer to include a [hyperlink]({{site.baseurl}}/style/text-conventions.html) or a [tertiary button]({{site.baseurl}}/components/buttons.html#tertiary-button-weight) CTA.

While most toasts do not need a CTA, you may want to include a CTA for the following reasons:

- The user has navigated away from the page where they initiated the process and needs to quickly navigate back. For example, the user creates a user, navigates away, and they want to navigate back to that user to configure their permission settings. In this scenario, a link that navigates the user to the details page is useful.
- If a process fails, it might be helpful to include a CTA so the user can retry the process.

If you include a footer, use these spacing guidelines.

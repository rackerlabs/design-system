## Lists

<section class="static-section"  markdown="1">

<div class="hxRow" markdown="1">
{% column left:"hxCol hxSpan-12-xs hxSpan-12-sm hxSpan-4-md hxSpan-4-lg" %}

### Unordered lists

Use unordered lists to group related items. Items in a list should share a similar level of importance. When possible, write bullet items to be approximately the same length. Keeping a uniform length is pleasing to the eye and makes the list more consumable to a user.

{% endcolumn %}

{% column right:"hxCol hxSpan-12-xs hxSpan-12-sm hxSpan-8-md hxSpan-8-lg" %}
{% figure [class:"image bg-light border"] %}
<embed src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/components/content-areas/lists/unordered-list.png" width="472"/>
{% endfigure %}
{% endcolumn %}
</div>

### Ordered lists

Use ordered lists for instances in which the items must occur in a specific order, such as steps in a procedure, or when counting items, such as a top 10 list.

If list items do not occur in a specific order, or the final count or rank of list items does not matter, don't number them. Instead, use an unordered list.

{% column right:"hxCol hxSpan-12-xs hxSpan-12-sm hxSpan-8-md hxSpan-8-lg" %}
{% figure [class:"image bg-light border"] %}
<embed src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/components/content-areas/lists/ordered-list.png" width="472"/>
{% endfigure %}
{% endcolumn %}

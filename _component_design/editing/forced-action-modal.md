## Forced Action Modal

Forced action modals are used when an action could have a potentially harmful
result for a customer. They are used to command the users attention by
obstructing view of all items not related to the action

- Centered vertically and horizontally
- Should be used very sparingly for non-routine tasks. Ex: Deleting an Account, Changing a Credit Card, or Updating Billing Information.
- Available as a whiteout or blackout pattern.

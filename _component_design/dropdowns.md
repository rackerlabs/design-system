# Drop-down fields

Drop-downs are a core input mechanism for form and are used to imply and offer
options or actions.

 {% endfigure %}

## When to use drop-downs

Drop-downs are used when a user is required to select a single option from
a known list of options. For example, selecting a region on the
Rackspace Cloud server create form will provide the following options:

* Chicago
* Dallas
* Hong Kong
* London
* Virginia

## Best practice for drop-downs

* Applying the disabled state to any options that are not currently available to
  the user.
* Keeping the drop-down pattern to a set of items that are easily parsable by a
  user. While there is not a hard rule here for an upperbounds limit of items
  to include a drop-down, once a drop-down data set exceeds 10 items it should
  be looked at to determine if it could be streamlined.
* Keeping the drop-down label viewable through all states of the dropdown. This
  ensures users remember what label prompted the data set they are viewing.

  Cards are good metaphors for cards in the real world. They are versatile, there can be many, and they allow us to see important information before digging in. As a content area, they can contain any kind of information.

### When to use

Cards allow the user to distinguish between sets of information more visually than the [Lists](lists) pattern. By providing the user with a familiar metaphor&emdash;i.e., we use cards in the real world,&emdash;it comes with sets of expectations that make them easy to use.

Use cards to present minimal high level information that allows the user to dig deeper. Do not use cards in place of hyper-robust data tables; also, be wary of using cards with a large quantity of data entries.

### Best practices

- Cards should be uniform in size.
- Donâ€™t overcrowd your card. It is not meant to hold a wealth of information, but high level views to dig deeper into.
- Cards are not always the right solution to displaying information. If the information would be better presented in a list or table, do so, or present both a list or table and a [grid](#grids) options.

## Overview

<div class="hxRow"  markdown="1">
{% column left:"hxCol hxSpan-12-xs hxSpan-12-sm hxSpan-4-md hxSpan-4-lg" %}

### Default layout

The card pattern is composed of the following three elements:

- **Header (optional):** The header sets the context for a card component and allows action on the card through the application of icons to it.
- **Body (required):** The body contains the primary content associated with the card. The body section details the underlying object, of which the card is representing to the user.
- **Footer (optional):** The footer serves to provide users with the calls to action that a user need take upon a card when applicable.

### Spacing

Each section of a card uses medium container spacing, 20px, by default.

Small and large spacing values can be used for card variations but should not be mixed and matched within a layout or card.

### Grid

Cards are applied to the [Helix grid](layouts/grid) and have a variable width and height based on content, current view-port, and use case.

- Default cards are styled with a `#FFFFFF` background and should only go on darker backgrounds.
- For more technical information, see [the HelixUI grid](https://rackerlabs.github.io/helix-ui/components/grid/).

### Offset

- In instances where only few cards are present, a designer may choose to offset the location of the first card in a row for aesthetic purposes. For more technical information, see [the HelixUI grid](https://rackerlabs.github.io/helix-ui/components/grid/).

### Card use

There is no limit to the number of cards that can be used; however, ensure the page use case justifies the data. For example, dashboards are meant to provide users with quick insights and clear paths forward to more robust data. Overusing cards as data objects may have the opposite effect and leave users with too much to parse.

### Segemented card

Cards that use all three of the underlying elements are referred to as a segmented card.

- **The header** may contain icons for card properties, card selection, duplication, deletion, etc.

- **The body** contains the meat of the card content. It contains some combination of text, images, icons, graphics or visualizations that detail the underlying object it represents.

- **The footer** houses calls for a user to act on a card through the use of buttons or links.

### Open card

Cards that opt to remove the header and footer elements and rely solely on the body element are referred to as open cards.

Open cards have fewer containing shapes than segmented cards and are therefore better for representing more focused or less complex objects.

### Loading

If an individual card or set of cards is loading, use the [spinner loading indicator](loading-indicators) centered vertically and horizontally within the card body element.


{% endcolumn %}

{% column right:"hxCol hxSpan-12-xs hxSpan-12-sm hxSpan-8-md hxSpan-8-lg" %}
{% figure [class:"image bg-light border"] %}

{% column left:"hxCol hxSpan-12-xs hxSpan-12-sm hxSpan-4-md hxSpan-4-lg" %}

### Empty card

When the card grid is user-customizable, the user interacts with the empty card to add a new card.


{% endcolumn %}

{% column right:"hxCol hxSpan-12-xs hxSpan-12-sm hxSpan-8-md hxSpan-8-lg" %}

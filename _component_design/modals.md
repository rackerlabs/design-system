Forced action modals are used when an action could have a potentially harmful
result for a customer. They are used to command the users attention by
obstructing view of all items not related to the action

-   Centered vertically and horizontally

-   Should be used very sparingly for non-routine tasks. Ex: Deleting an
    Account, Changing a Credit Card, or Updating Billing Information.

-   Available as a whiteout or blackout pattern.

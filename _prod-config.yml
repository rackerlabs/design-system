  This is a UI style guide for the getcarina.com control panel v2.0. Here you will find a listing of the components available within the new 
  design system. Once specifications are created for each component we will work with our developer partners to 
  generate associated code for use and reuse across racksapce products.
baseurl: "/design-system" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://design.rax.io/design-system" # the base hostname & protocol for your site

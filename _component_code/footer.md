# Footer

The footer lives at the bottom of the page to help visitors find
globally applicable, but non-primary navigation information. We
recommend using it on every page and every wrapped application. For
customer applications, it  should not exceed the articulated scope.

## When to use footers

Use the Rackspace footer on every application page to provide consistent
global functionality on all of our platforms.

## Best practices for footers

Ensure the footer is placed at the bottom of the page, and flush to the right
of any left-hand navigation, spanning the length of the screen. Ensure the
footer contains the following:

* Rackspace copyright and year
* A link to website terms and conditions
* A link to the privacy policy

# Specifications

## Footer scope

Place the footer at the bottom of the navigational page.
It should also be flush to the left navigation or, if using top navigation,
the footer container goes across the bottom of the entire page. The footer
must contain copyright information with links to Rackspace website terms
and privacy policy.

* Website Terms: https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/websiteterms
* Privacy Policy: https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/privacystatement

For customer applications, do not add additional functionality to the footer.

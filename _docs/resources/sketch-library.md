There are two approaches to installing the Helix library:

1. **Use Google Drive sync on your computer** The primary
benefit of this approach is that you automatically receive updates made to the
library.

2. **Download directly from GitHub** This approach
involves downloading a copy of the library from Github, saving it to
your local machine, and then loading the library into Sketch. The primary
benefit of this approach is that it is easier to set up, but you do not
automatically receive updates and must download the library each time there is
an update.

{% include note.html content="The Helix Team sends an email each time the Helix library is updated.
If you are not a part of the Helix email distribution list, you can request
access by emailing [helix@rackspace.com](mailto:helix@rackspace.com)." %}

### Install the Sketch Library from Google Drive
Complete the following tasks to install the Sketch Library from your Google
Drive.

Before you begin:

have access to a Google Drive. For more information, see [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

- Install a licensed copy of [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com). If you do not have a copy of Sketch, email [helix@rackspace.com](mailto:helix@rackspace.com) to request a license.

to the Helix Sketch Library. The Helix Team will provide a copy of the library
to your **Shared with me** folder.

My Drive.

6. On the **My Laptop** panel, choose folders that you want to back up.


{% include note.html content="You do not need to use the back up feature to work with the Sketch
library. You can clear all checkboxes on the **My Laptop** panel, and click
**Next**" %}

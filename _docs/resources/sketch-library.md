## Sketch Library

There are two approaches to installing the Helix library:

1. **You can install the Sketch library from your Google Drive.** The primary
benefit of this approach is that you automatically receive updates made to the
library.

2. **You can install the Sketch library from your local machine.** This approach
involves downloading a copy of the library from Github, saving it to
your local machine, and then loading the library into Sketch. The primary
benefit of this approach is that it is easier to set up, but you do not
automatically receive updates and must download the library each time there is
an update.

**Note:** The Helix Team sends an email each time the Helix library is updated.
If you are not a part of the Helix email distribution list, you can request
access by emailing helix@rackspace.com.

### Install the Sketch library from Google Drive
Complete the following tasks to install the Sketch library from your Google
Drive.

Before you begin:

- Ensure that you have a Google Drive account. If you have a Gmail account, you
have access to a Google Drive. For more information, see [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

- Install a licensed copy of [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com). If you do not have a copy of Sketch, email helix@rackspace.com to request a license.

### Task 1: Move the shared Sketch library to your Google Drive account

<section class="static-section" markdown="1">
<div class="hxRow" markdown="1">

{% column left:"hxCol-4 hxCol-xs-12 hxCol-sm-12 hxCol-md-4 hxCol-lg-4" %}

After you sign up for a Google Drive account, if the library has not already
been made available to you, send an email to the Helix Team requesting access
to the Helix Sketch library. The Helix Team will provide a copy of the library
to your **Shared with me** folder.

Complete the following task to move the shared library to My Drive.

<p><b>1.</b> Log in to Google Drive, and click <b>Shared Driv</b>.</p>

Google Backup and Sync is a free product that you use to synchronize changes
made to the shared Helix library files and the Helix library stored on your
My Drive.

You only need to use the synchronization feature included in Google Backup and
Sync. You can configure Google Backup and Sync to back up your files, but it
not required.

5. On the **My Laptop** panel, choose folders that you want to back up.

   **NOTE:** You do not need to use the back up feature to work with the Sketch
library. You can clear all checkboxes on the **My Laptop** panel, and click
**Next**.

6. Click **Sync only these folders**.

7. From the list of folders, select the **Helix Library** folder, and click **Start**.

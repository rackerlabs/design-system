There are two options for installing the Helix library:

**1. Use Google Drive sync on your computer**<br>The primary benefit of this approach is that you automatically receive updates made to the library.

**2. Download directly from GitHub**<br>This approach involves downloading a copy of the library from Github, saving it to
your local machine, and then loading the library into Sketch. The primary
benefit of this approach is that it is easier to set up, but you do not
automatically receive updates and must download the library each time there is
an update.

{% include note.html content="We send an email any time the Helix library is updated.
If you are not on the distribution list, you can request
access by emailing [helix@rackspace.com](mailto:helix@rackspace.com)." %}

### 1. Use Google Drive sync on your computer
Complete the following tasks to install the Sketch Library from your Google
Drive.

have access to a Google Drive. For more information, see [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

- Install a licensed copy of [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com). If you do not have a copy of Sketch, email [helix@rackspace.com](mailto:helix@rackspace.com) to request a license.

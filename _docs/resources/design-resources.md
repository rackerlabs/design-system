## How to set it up

In order to use the full feature set of the Craft library or start from the
latest version of the Sketch template, sync the shared
OneDrive folder to your computer.

### Syncing a Shared OneDrive folder

-   **Make sure that your version of OneDrive was downloaded from the Managed
Software Center.** Rackspace has built an update to the program that enables  syncing shared folders. Downloading from another source will not
work. If your computer does not have the Managed Software Center installed on
it, you'll need to go to O'Fixies to install it.

-   Visit the link above and click the "Sync" button.

-   Sync the folder to create a second OneDrive folder on your computer.
    This adds the folder as a second location to your OneDrive App.

## How to use

### Sketch Template

<<<<<<#div class="hxRow"  markdown="1">
{%- column left:"hxCol-md-4" -%}

If you choose the Sketch template, you can create a new file from it and edit it
as you wish without affecting the original document. Sketch maintains the link
to the template in your "New from Template" menu. So if you selected it from
the shared drive above, it will always access the most up to date file.

### Craft Library

<<<<<<#div class="hxRow"  markdown="1">
{%- column left:"hxCol-md-4" -%}

If you aren't familiar with Craft, it is a Sketch add-on that includes a
feature for shared libraries. If imported into your project the Craft library
will automatically alert you when new assets are available.

If you've never used Craft before, take a minute to learn about
it before diving in:

## Understanding accessibility

An accessible UI is designed so that it can be *accessed* and used by people who suffer from a permanent or a temporary impairment. While visual impairments such as color blindness and lack of sight are two of the most obvious impairments to consider, an impairment can also be auditory, physical, or cognitive. For example, a user who suffers from a concussion may experience difficulty processing information, so ensure that you write succinct on-page instructions and labels. A user who experiences hand tremors as a side effect to medication has difficulty operating a mouse, so design pointer targets so they are large enough.

Designing for accessibility is best practice because you consider all users and not just those with a permanent disability.

The purpose of this document is to articulate guidelines that you can use when you design control panel page. The list of guidelines is not exhaustive. Refer to [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1]({{https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/}}) for a complete list of guidelines.

### Why accessibility is important

Accessibility is more than just good design. It's about the empathy for and inclusion of all people. Consider sight. [Colour Blind Awareness](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/) estimates that:

- 4.5% of the global population experience color blindness (1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women)
- 4% suffer from low vision (1 in 30 people)
- 0.6% are blind (1 in 188 people)

With a global population of just over 7.5 billion people, 9.1% of the world's population equates to over one-half billion visually-impaired user that cannot use an inaccessible product. After factoring in the myriad other forms of permanent and temporary impairments, designing inaccessible products can have a material and negative impact on a large percent of users.

Not only can inaccessible design reflect poorly on our brand, it has the potential for legal ramifications. In 2018, there were at least 2258 lawsuits filed in federal court under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), an increase of 177% of such lawsuits filed in 2017.

### How Helix supports accessibility

The core Helix team has taken the following steps to help ensure that your UIs are accessible:

- To increase the probability that a screen reader interprets a UI correctly, we have developed components that include the appropriate `aria-*` and `role` attributes, where necessary, and use semantic markup as much as possible. These efforts alone do not guarantee screen reader accessibility, as accessibility is mostly dependent on the UI being developed.
- To the greatest extent possible, we follow the guidelines set forth by the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) to ensure keyboard accessibility.
- Accessibility is built into the Helix color palette and hex codes. If you adhere to the color palette, you will be in compliance.
- We have designed the spacing system, focus states, and typography to conform to accessibility standards.
- All design specifications we have written support accessibility.

While the core Helix Team has worked to provide you with code and specifications that support accessibility, it is ultimately the responsibility of individual designers and developers to ensure that UIs are accessible.

### Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning

Color deficiency is a common issue that is faced in the design process. The most common form of color blindness is known as red and green color deficiency, and most color deficient people suffer from either Protanopia (less sensitivity to red light) or Deuteranopia (less sensitivity to green light). Red and green color deficiency can mean that those affected have trouble distinguishing certain hues of red and green. For example, an individual with red or green color deficiency can confuse blue and purple because they might not be able to distinguish the red element of purple.

While color can be useful to convey information, it should not be the only way to convey information. When you use color to differentiate elements, you should also provide additional identification that does not rely on color perception. For example, XXXX

There should always be a backup visual indicator for people with color blindness.

Alert bars are a great example of how multiple indicators can be used. If you are indicating an error alert (for example, making it red), always include a status icon and alert description so that someone who is color blind can still see the problem.

Other optional indicators to consider are the following elements:

- **Alert type:** An optional alert title descriptor.
- **Alert action link:** Provides a user with the next step of a process.
- **Close action:** Closes the alert.

### Ensure that there is sufficient contrast between text and its background

Readability requires sufficient contrast between the text and its background. Low contrast is especially problematic for users with low vision who also often have contrast sensitivity.

To ensure text is readable, Helix adheres to the accessibility standards defined by [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). These standards are based on contrast ratios calculated from text size, text color, and background color.

Helix minimum contrast standards require the following elements:

- Small text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background color.
- Large text (at 14px bold or 18px regular and up) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
- We recommend using the contrast ratios for icons or other critical elements.

## Visual feedback guidelines

Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission, alerting the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of changes on the page. Ensure instructions are easy to identify and provide suggestions to help fix issues whenever errors are returned. Prominently present any important feedback that requires user action.

### Failed text inputs

There are many acceptable ways to make text inputs visually accessible. If you're indicating a failed text input, make sure to include multiple visual indicators. For example, in addition to the error message, the border color turns red to draw the eye and doubles in thickness from 1px to 2px to provide another distinguishable visual cue that is not reliant on color.

It is important to reserve the prominent border at 2px for failed text input as an additional visual indicator for error an state.

### Focus for Input Field

In this example, we provide a clear visual feedback that the focus has moved to the input field by changing the border color and adding a highlight to give the user clear indication of where theyâ€™re currently taking action.

### Be consistent with headings

Users that use screen readers can listen to all of the headings on a page and then choose which content area they want to explore. Because screen readers read header tags in the order they appear, it is important that you not skip header levels. The structure of a page hierarchy should be logical. For example, don't skip from a Header 1 to a Header 3, and then back to a Header 2.

### Use headings and spacing to group related content

The use of space in visual design provides for designs that are both clear and pleasing to the eyes. Space creates relationships, defines hierarchies, and emphasizes content. Always keep these in mind when considering how to reduce visual noise and create visual flow in your design.

Some people with cognitive disabilities find it difficult to read text when the lines are close together. Providing extra space between lines and paragraphs allows them to better track the next line and to recognize when they have reached the end of a paragraph. The [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) prescribes that line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.

Helix minimum spacing standards require:Â 

- Line spacing for Roboto Regular 16px is 24px.
- Spacing below paragraphs is 16px.
- Use whitespace and proximity to make relationships between content more apparent.
- Style headings group content, reduce clutter, and make it easier to scan and understand.

### Don't use tables for layout

A screen readers is capable of reading the contents of tables, but don't use tables for anything other than data presentation. Because a screen reader reads every row and column of a table, including secondary text or data in additional rows can be annoying to the user.

## Interactivity guidelines

Intro text here...

### Ensure that pointer targets are large enough

Pointer targets that are activated by a mouse, trackball, or stylus should be at least 44 dp x 44 dp in size. Large pointer targets can be helpful to users who have difficulty with fine motor skills.

### Don't make users hover to find hidden controls

Users that use screen readers or the keyboard to navigate to and select components rely on them to be visible. Don't hide components as a way to reduce visual clutter. If a control cannot be seen, it cannot be verbally selected.

### Write meaningful alternative text forÂ images

Screen readers read the text you enter in the <alt> tag that you associate with an image. IfÂ an image provides importantÂ contextual information, then use the <alt> tag to describe what is happening in the picture.Â If the image is decorative, then add an empty <alt> tag, otherwise the screen reader might read the name of the image file, which results in a terrible user experience.

## Text guidelines

Intro text here...

### Be succinct

Write short labels and be concise when writing helper text.Â Listening to lengthy field names and links can be cumbersome forÂ users that use screen readers.Â The shorter the label, the more quickly a screen reader can work through the content.

### Identify required fields

Use the HTML 5 required attribute to distinguish between required and not required fields.Â Screen reader cannot interpret an asterisk (``*``), which is the convention used to visually identify required fields.

### Link text should convey what happens when clicked

Sentences that include links should include a text description before the link and then a unique name for the link. Do not use Click Here as a link naming convention. For example, use 'Visit the About page to learn more about our process' and not 'Click here to learn more about our process'.

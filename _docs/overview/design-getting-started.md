## Learn the language

<div class="hxRow large">

{% column left:"hxCol-8 hxCol-xs-12 hxCol-sm-12 hxCol-md-8 hxCol-lg-8" %}

Familiarize yourself with the concepts that define the Helix language, and then see how they actualize in specific components for our UIs. 

- **Principles**: The ideas and guidelines for designing to the Helix language.
- **Style**: You’ll find colors, typography, iconography, and other aesthetic guidelines.
- **Components**: You’ll find the elements used to design our UIs, when to use them, and even code examples.

## Use the language

<div class="hxRow">

{% column left:"hxCol-8 hxCol-xs-12 hxCol-sm-12 hxCol-md-8 hxCol-lg-8" %}

Our primary resource for using the Helix design language is our sketch-based sticker sheet. You can copy and paste elements from this sticker sheet into your own sketch documents to use in your designs.

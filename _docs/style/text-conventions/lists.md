## Unordered lists

Use unordered lists to group related items. Items in a list should share a similar level of importance. When possible, write bullet items to be approximately the same length. Keeping a uniform length is pleasing to the eye and makes the list more consumable to a user.

## Ordered lists

Use ordered lists for instances in which the items must occur in a specific order, such as steps in a procedure, or when counting items, such as a top 10 list.

If list items do not occur in a specific order, or the final count or rank of list items does not matter, don't number them. Instead, use an unordered list.

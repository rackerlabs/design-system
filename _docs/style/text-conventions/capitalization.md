  User interface (UI) elements use a combination of title-style, sentence-style, and all-caps capitalization. When you use different capitalization styles for different types of content, you can improve scannability, organize information, and guide users to key actions. It is important to apply these capitalization guidelines consistently to make the UI clear and succinct.

## Title-style capitalization

For title-style capitalization, capitalize the first letter of nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and pronouns in the text. You also capitalize the first and last words of the text. However, use lowercase for the following exceptions:

- Articles (*a, an, the*) unless they are the first or last words of the element.
- Coordinating conjunctions (*and, or*).
- Prepositions with fewer than five letters (*to, on, at, by, from*) unless they are the first or last words of the element.
- Infinitives (*to, in, an*).
- Capitalize the second word in a hyphenated compound if it would normally be capitalized as a single word. For example, you would capitalize both words in **Quick-Find** Options, but you would only capitalize **Add** in Add-on Choices.

The following table includes examples for title-style capitalization:

## Sentence-style capitalization

For sentence-style capitalization, most words are lowercase, with the following exceptions:

- Capitalize the first letter of the first word of the text element.
- Capitalize the first letter of any other words that you would normally capitalize, such as proper nouns.

The following table shows examples for sentence-style capitalization:

The following elements use all-caps capitalization:

- Header 5

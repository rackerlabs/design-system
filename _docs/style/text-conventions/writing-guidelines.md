## Write clearly and objectively

Use the following guidelines to help you write clearly and objectively:

- Consider a userâ€™s likely goal, desire, or state of mind. Anticipate confusion or frustration and respond appropriately.
- Choose language that is clear and easy to understand. When possible, use fewer words. Every word should provide valuable information to the user.
- Do not use humor, jargon, exclamation marks, idioms, metaphors, and other colloquialisms.
- Avoid non sequiturs, obscure references, or non-standard turns of phrase that might confuse or interrupt.
- Help users avoid errors and roadblocks. Make sure content helps users recover quickly if those things happen.
- Inform users if they can't undo changes before they make the change. Explain consequences and alternatives.

## Write with active voice

Active voice makes the performer of the action (usually the user) the subject of the sentence. Passive voice makes the recipient of the action (not the performer) the subject of the sentence.

Active-voice sentences are more engaging, less complicated, less wordy, and easier to understand than passive-voice sentences. With active voice, the actions and responses of the user are easier to distinguish from the actions and responses of the technology.

## Use second person

Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them directly. You talk to users directly by using second person, addressing the user as **you**. Second person also promotes a friendly tone.

## Maintain parallel construction

Parallel construction means that parallel ideas must be presented in parallel grammatical form. This means that each part of a sentence or sentence fragment that serves the same function uses the same grammatical structure.

When writing a series, it is important that each element in the series performs the same function, that of the object of the verb.

Parallel structure also applies to options you present to users. Don't ask users to choose from unrelated values.

In this example, **Always** and **Never** are opposites. **Always** and **Blocked** are not opposites.

## Provide context

Provide meaningful descriptions for key features and state their importance to help users understand the benefits. Don't use Rackspace-created terms as a substitute for clearly explaining options.

## Focus on user goals

Create content that anticipates user needs and explains how a Rackspace feature or option helps the user accomplish a goal. Don't explain the technical details of what a Rackspace service is doing.

Aligning UI text with user goals requires that you understand the subtleties of your audience and how a feature supports what the user is trying to do.

## Write accurate and descriptive labels

A label is a static element that displays text on a control panel page. Page titles, section titles, and subsection titles are examples of labels.

When writing labels, consider the following guidelines:

- Label content areas concisely. Use fewer words in a label to help the scanability of the content on a page.
- Write accurate labels that reflect the content the label introduces.
- Write descriptive labels. Descriptive labels communicate better with users than non-descriptive labels.
- Use parallel construction when labeling the sections of a control panel.

## Avoid abbreviations

Avoid abbreviations, acronyms, and slang. Use an abbreviation only if it is better known than the word that it stands for or if saving space is critical.

Unless an abbreviation is common, spell out the words of the abbreviation on the first use. Show the abbreviation in parentheses after the spelled-out term; for example, access control list (ACL). On subsequent uses, use the abbreviation. If you introduce an abbreviation, use it; don't alternate between the abbreviation and the spelled-out term.

The primary job of the words in a UI is to help users complete tasks with no
confusion and minimal interruption. However, the voice and tone that we use
with words in a UI also influence how people think and feel about Rackspace.

Voice is our style, and communicates our personality to the user. Tone is our mood,
and communicates our attitude about the subject to the user.

The words we choose—and the ways we use them—should reflect our goals: building trust, inspiring confidence, making things easier, and developing a relationship with Rackspace users.

When you write UI text, use words that reflect the following attributes:

- Human
- Trustworthy
- Knowledgeable
- Accurate
- Professional
- Approachable
- Helpful

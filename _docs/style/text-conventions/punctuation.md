## Periods

End all sentences with a period, even if they're only two words. Put one space, not two, after a period.

Note: An exception is that you don’t use end punctuation in a tooltip.

## Commas

For clarity, use serial commas (also called Oxford commas).

## Apostrophes and quotation marks

Use apostrophes to indicate possession and use quotation marks to refer to text literally. Apostrophes and quotation marks come in two forms: curly quotes and straight quotes.

Curly quotes are preferred to straight quotes because curly quotes are more leg­i­ble on the page and match the other char­ac­ters bet­ter.

There are four curly quote char­ac­ters:

- open­ing sin­gle quote ( <span markdown='0'>&lsquo;</span> )
- clos­ing sin­gle quote ( <span markdown='0'>&rsquo;</span> )
- open­ing dou­ble quote ( <span markdown='0'>&ldquo;</span> )
- clos­ing dou­ble quote ( <span markdown='0'>&rdquo;</span> )

If curly quotes are not an option, use straight quotes. Straight quotes are the two generic vertical quotation marks located near the return key:

- straight single quote ( <span markdown='0'>'</span> )
- straight double quote ( <span markdown='0'>"</span> )

Consider the following examples when you include apostrophes and quotation marks on a control panel page.

## Hyphens and dashes

Use the following rules for hyphens and dashes:

{% figure [caption:"Hyphens and dashes"] [class:"image bg-light border"] %}
| Element | Description | Guideline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hyphen | Use a hyphen (-) to create a single idea out of two or more words. | Don’t add a space before or after the hyphen. |
| En dash | Use an en dash (&ndash;) for ranges, like numbers (such as, 1&ndash;9) and dates. | Don’t add a space before or after the en dash. |
| Em dash | Use an em dash (&mdash;), the longest dash, to set off a long qualifier in the middle of a sentence if the use of commas would hinder readability. | Don’t add a space before or after the em dash.<br /><br />Don’t capitalize the word following an em dash, unless the word is proper.<br /><br />Don’t use an em dash to separate a long sentence into two parts. Instead, create two sentences. |

## Ellipses

Consider the following best practices when you use ellipses:

- Use ellipses with Button or Menu components when the action requires additional user input, usually with a dialog, an alert, or a move to another window or part of the UI.
- Do not use an ellipsis in a link to indicate that more information is available at the destination.
- In general, do not use ellipses in body copy.
- To truncate text in the middle of a word or phrase, the total length of the pattern is 31 characters comprised of 14 characters on either side of the ellipses in the middle.
- If the amount of text exceeds the space available in the container, then use end truncation. Place a minimum of seven characters before the ellipses. The maximum number of characters you can place before the ellipses is equal to the length of the container minus three characters.

## Exclamation points

Avoid using exclamation points. If you must use them, use them sparingly&mdash;when the text reflects genuine excitement, not as a way to create excitement.

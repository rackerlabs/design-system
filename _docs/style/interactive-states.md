title: Interactive States
layout: docs

usage: >
  The system of interactive states ensures consistent styles for the states of controls in Helix. This system accounts for multiple types of controls, with various interactive patterns, and defines commonalities and standards across all of them.

  Unless otherwise noted in their individual design docs, all controls that live in the application body strictly adhere to subsets of the specifications in this document.

## When to use

Use the styles for the interactive states when you design a control or input that you place within the body of the application. Consistent use of interactive state styles ensure that your design is aligned and consistent with Helix.

## Best practices

Consider the following best practices when you construct interactive states:

- In general, only apply hovered states to selectable controls. For example, checkboxes and radios have a hover state, but text inputs do not.
- Do not apply all state styles to your inputs or controls.
- When you design a new control, consult other similar controls to understand which interactive states apply.
- Avoid using selected filled styles for large controls, such as tiles or cards.
- If you have an input or control that is selected and errored, consider if there is a better interaction design that prevents the user from getting into that state.

## Specifications

Use the following specifications when you construct an interactive UI element.

### Composition

In this document, a circle within a square represents a state style.

An interactive state is comprised of the following elements:

- **Control**: The control is the container of the UI component to which you apply the interactive state.
- **Emphasis color**: Apply the emphasis color to a primary child element within a control.

The following list of elements receive emphasis color:

- Checks in checkboxes
- Circles in radios
- Icons in option tiles
- Labels in selector strips

### Style

Unless otherwise specified, all inputs and controls have a border radius of 2px.

### Unselected styles

In most cases, you apply unselected styles to controls that the user selects, such as option tiles, checkboxes, and radios. In some cases you apply unselected styles to general controls such as text input and drop-down selectors.

You are not required to apply all unselected styles to an input or control. For example, in the default state, a text input receives only the unselected idle style. Do not apply any of the other three unselected styles to a text input.

Only multi-select controls, like checkboxes, use the unselected focused state. Single-select controls such as radios, do not have an unselected focused state, because they are automatically selected when focused.

### Selected styles

Selected styles are most often used for selectable controls, like checkboxes. However, some selected styles can also be used for other controls like text inputs or drop-down selectors.

You are not required to apply all selected styles to an input or control. For example, text inputs use the selected focused style for the focused state, but they do not use any of the other three styles.

#### Selected with fill

Apply selected fill styles to elements that benefit from a more apparent selected state, including checkboxes, radios, switches, and toggles.

### Errored styles

Use these specifications when you construct an input or control in an errored state.

#### Errored and selected with fill

It is nearly impossible for a selectable control to be selected *and* errored. However, some edge cases do exist.

The error and selected-with-fill styles primarily apply to controls with unique interactive patterns such as selector strips, toggles, and switches.

**Note**: In this example, the container still receives the standard red stroke, and the selected option is filled. This combination is common for controls that use this style for indicating errors.

### Disabled styles

Disabled controls generally cannot receive focus, although there are cases where an input becomes disabled on click. In that scenario, the control receives focus even though it is disabled.

#### Disabled and selected with fill

Disabled and selected with fill is an uncommon state that occurs when a selectable control is selected and disabled by default. This state can occur when a user makes a previous choice that requires this input to be selected and disabled.

{% endcolumn %}

{% column right:"hxCol hxSpan-12-xs hxSpan-12-sm hxSpan-8-md hxSpan-8-lg" %}

### Focus glow styles

The focus glow style identifies which interactive element has focus.

Use the child focus border for focusable child elements, such as the clear button on a search input.

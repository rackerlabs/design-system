### Prerequisites

To create mockups using the Helix design language, you will need Sketch. [Download Sketch here](http://www.sketchapp.com). You can learn more about Sketch by watching the following [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEplnCnZuDM&list=PLWlUJU11tp4fEXI8deWhBQAHDv9R23WHB).

### Learn the language

Familiarize yourself with the concepts that define the Helix language. Through this site, you can see how they appear in the layouts, styles, and componenets used in Rackspace UIs. 

- **Principles**: Ideas and guidelines for making good, consistent decisions when designing in Helix.
- **Style**: Colors, typography, iconography, timestamps, and other stylistic standards.
- **Components**: Youâ€™ll find the elements used to design our UIs, when to use them, and even code examples.

### Design mockups in Helix

The best way to bring Helix components into your designs is with the Helix Sketch Sticker Sheet. You can copy and paste elements from this sticker sheet into your own Sketch documents to use in your designs.

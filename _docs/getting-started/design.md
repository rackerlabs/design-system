### Prerequisites

- To create mockups using the Helix design language, you will need Sketch. [Download Sketch here](http://www.sketchapp.com).
- You can learn more about Sketch by watching the following [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEplnCnZuDM&list=PLWlUJU11tp4fEXI8deWhBQAHDv9R23WHB).

### Learn the language

Familiarize yourself with the concepts that define the Helix language. Through this site, you can see how they appear in the layouts, styles, and components used in Rackspace UIs.

- **Principles**: Ideas and guidelines for making good, consistent decisions when designing in Helix.
- **Style**: Colors, typography, iconography, timestamps, and other stylistic standards.
- **Components**: Youâ€™ll find the elements used to design our UIs, when to use them, and even code examples.

### Use the language

Once you have familiarized yourself with the Helix language, it's time to start using it!

The Helix team has created a collection of resources aimed at helping designers start designing or developing with Helix. This includes a sketch library and a low-fidelity sticker sheet, as well as `codepen` and `npm` resources.

Find all this and more on the [resources page]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/index.html).
